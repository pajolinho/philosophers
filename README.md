# Philosophers 

The **Philosophers** project at Ã‰cole 42 is based on the classic *Dining Philosophers Problem*.  
The challenge is to avoid **deadlocks** (everyone waiting forever) and **starvation** (someone never eating) while respecting strict timing rules.  

### What this project teaches:
- Multithreading & process management in C  
- Synchronization with mutexes & semaphores  
- Timing, resource sharing, and preventing race conditions  
- Problem-solving in concurrent systems
